How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
I used :define_method to create the coloring methods for the strings

How long did you spend working on this project?
About 4 hours. I watched the initial videos and did the read through of the content and then didn't start the project for 2+ weeks. I wasn't really interested in creating a gem and the metaprogramming didn't seem interesting to me either. I was also confused at the real world applications (outside of gems) for metaprogramming.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Figuring out how to change the colors by using the "\e[#{color_code}m#{self}\e[0m" line. Putting in self there stumped me for a bit and once I figured that out, it helped a lot. Also figuring out how to brighten the colors to do white and light_grey was nice too.


Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I can continue to be better with metaprogramming and continue to learn that. I'm still a bit confused on real life applications of this outside of gems.
